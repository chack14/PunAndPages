                <h2>1984 by George Orwell</h2>
                <h2>â‚±395.00</h2>

                <h3>The novel is set in 1984 in Oceania, one of three eternally warring totalitarian governments (the other two being Eurasia and Eastasia). 
                Oceania is ruled by the all-powerful Party, which has brainwashed the populace into blind loyalty to its leader, Big Brother. 
                The Party has established Newspeak, a propagandistic language intended to stifle free thought and promote the Party's ideologies. 
                Its terms include doublethink (believing in conflicting notions at the same time), as evidenced by the Party's slogans: "War is peace," "Freedom is slavery," and "Ignorance is strength." 
                
                The Party maintains control through the Thought Police and ongoing surveillance. Winston Smith, the book's hero, is a minor party functionary living in a London still shattered by a nuclear war that occurred not long after World War II. 
                He belongs to the Outer Party and works in the Ministry of Truth to rewrite history in line with current political thinking. However, Winston's desire for truth and decency drives him to quietly rebel against the authorities. 
                He begins an illicit romance with Julia, a like-minded woman, and they rent an apartment in a district filled by Proles (proletariats). Winston also grows more interested in the Brotherhood, a group of dissenters. 
                Winston and Julia have no idea that they are being attentively watched. Posters all across the city warn citizens that "Big Brother is watching you.Posters all across the city warn citizens that "Big Brother is watching you."
