    <body>  Ignatius J. Reilly, an obese young man dressed in a hunting cap and other strange attire, waits for his mother, Irene, outside of a department store in New Orleans, Louisiana. Ignatius is a medieval scholar who despises the modern world. 
        While Ignatius waits, a policeman Patrolman Mancuso approaches and tries to arrest him because he looks suspicious. Ignatius gets into a fight with Mancuso, and an old man, Claude Robichaux, tries to defend Ignatius. When Irene exits the shop,
        she screams at Patrolman Mancuso to arrest Claude who she claims must have started things and she and Ignatius escape. They hide in a nearby strip club called the Night of Joy, where they order beers. Ignatius and Irene strike up a conversation
        with the bar girl, Darlene, and a fashionable young man named Dorian Greene, until the proprietor, Lana Lee, returns and throws them out Ignatius and Irene are not the sort of customers she wants in her bar. Irene is very drunk by this time, 
        and as she tries to drive away, she crashes her car. Patrolman Mancuso, who is walking home, comes across the wreck and gives Irene a $1,000 fine.

        At the police station, Claude Robichaux shares a cell with a black man named Burma Jones, who has been framed and arrested for stealing cashew nuts. Even though the police know that Jones is not guilty, he is kept in jail. Claude is sent home 
        the sergeant realizes that he was involved in a misunderstanding and blames Patrolman Mancuso. The sergeant decides that, from now on, Mancuso must wear a different fancy dress costume to work each day until he apprehends a genuinely suspicious character. 
        Jones is released, too, but told that he must find a job or he will be arrested as a vagrant. Jones finds his way to the Night of Joy and miserably takes an advertised job as porter. Lana will pay him much less than minimum wage, but Jones cannot afford
        to turn the job down besides, Lana says she will call the police on him if he tries to quit. Jones befriends Darlene, who tells him that she wants to become an exotic dancer.
