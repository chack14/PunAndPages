        <h2>Fifty Shades Trilogy by E. L. James </h2>
        <h2>₱1152.86</h2>

        <h3>The books tell the life of Anastasia Steele, as she is finishing her college years and graduate soon. She’s forced into interviewing Mr. Grey for her best friend, Kate, who has the flu. 
        She embarrasses herself in front of Mr. Grey by not checking with Kate about his background information and by asking him if he is, in fact, gay. Mr. Grey is intrigued by Ana, to the point 
        of showing up at her work and asking her some personal questions. He hands her his business card for a photo shoot for the school paper. Jose, Ana and Kate go out for drinks. Ana and Jose get
        wasted and Ana accidentally dials Christian’s number. He shows up as soon as Jose tries to kiss Ana. Christian takes Ana to his hotel suit, where he takes care of her, as in, holding her hair 
        back as she pukes. This starts their BDSM relationship, after he makes love to her, making her lose her virginity to him. That’s only one of their many “firsts”. He buys her a car, new clothes, 
        first edition books, … etc… and in return, all she has to do is be his sex slave. All that doesn’t sit too well with Ana. She is very cautious but curious. She never does sign the paperwork. 
        However, she does participate in the “Red room of pain” where Christian “aims to please”.  Some of it was too much for dear Ana, some of it she liked. In the end, it made her leave him because 
        she didn’t know how to deal with him anymore.
